    "# 1.Classes and Objects:\n",
    "# Class: A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), which defines a set of attributes and methods that the object will have.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 2.Encapsulation:\n",
    "# The concept of wrapping the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is useful for preventing unintended interference and misuse of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.Abstraction:\n",
    "# The process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. Abstraction allows focusing on what an object does instead of how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.Inheritance:\n",
    "# A mechanism where a new class (child class) inherits properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (parent class). This promotes code reuse and can also add new attributes or methods to the child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.Polymorphism:\n",
    "# The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways. Polymorphism allows methods to be used interchangeably between different object types, provided they share the same method signature.\n",
